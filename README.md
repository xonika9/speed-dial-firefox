# Super Speedy Dial

Download from the [Speed Dial New Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/speed-dial-new-tab/)

This Firefox extension transforms your homepage and new tab page into a visually appealing bookmark speed dial, taking inspiration from the Opera browser.  It seamlessly integrates with your existing Firefox bookmarks and is designed for a sleek look, smooth performance, and effortless usability.  Feel free to explore and utilize the code as you wish.

The user interface is built using [Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com), a remarkably efficient reactive JavaScript framework that also provides a delightful developer experience.

## Data Collection
